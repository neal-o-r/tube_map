# Tube Map

It's always kinda bugged me that the Tube map has no scale. It warps your sense of geography when places that are East-West (or North-South) of one another are reversed on the Tube map, or when places that are very close together seem far apart. When I first moved to the city I decided to look at some Tube data to better orient myself.
